## ðŸ”Œ How to Run

1. Ensure MySQL is running and all DBs are created:
    - `user_db`, `vehicle_db`, `parking_db`, `payment_db`

2. Start the services in the following order:
    - `config-server`
    - `eureka-server`
    - `api-gateway`
    - `user-service`
    - `vehicle-service`
    - `parking-service`
    - `payment-service`

3. Import Postman collection into Postman and test all endpoints.
